    <h2>Welcome to RahulGandhi wikipedia</h2>
<p>Rahul Gandhi (born June 19, 1970, Delhi, India) is an Indian politician and leading figure of the Indian National Congress (Congress Party). He was born the son of Rajiv Gandhi, a grandson of Indira Gandhi, and a great grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru, all of whom served as prime ministers of India. His mother, Sonia Gandhi, also played a leading role in the Congress Party. Gandhi led the Congress Party and the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
    Rahul Gandhi kept a low public profile for much of his early life. He was homeschooled after the assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984. He began his university education at St. Stephen’s College in Delhi and later attended Harvard University, but he transferred to Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, after his father’s assassination, in 1991. He received a bachelor’s degree in 1994, and a year later he earned a master’s degree from Trinity College, Cambridge. He then worked with a consulting firm in the United Kingdom before returning to India and helping establish a firm in Mumbai.
    Gandhi entered politics in 2004 when he was elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time. He kept his seat there following the 2009 contest. In 2013 he was named the Congress Party’s vice president and became its de facto (though never official) candidate for prime minister in the 2014 polls. Although he again retained his Lok Sabha seat in that election, his party suffered a humiliating loss to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after the Congress’s image had been tarnished by a string of corruption scandals. Despite the Congress Party’s poor performance at the polls, Gandhi and his mother retained their leadership positions.</p>
